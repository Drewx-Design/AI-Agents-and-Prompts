# Update Pattern Discovery

When you discover a reusable pattern that should be standardized.

```
DISCOVERED REUSABLE PATTERN

Through implementation, discovered a pattern we should standardize:

PATTERN DISCOVERED:
[DESCRIBE THE PATTERN]

EXAMPLE:
```code
[SHOW CODE EXAMPLE]
```

WHERE IT APPLIES:
- [USE CASE 1]
- [USE CASE 2]
- [USE CASE 3]

Please:
1. Add to RULES.md as standard pattern
2. Update any similar code to use pattern
3. Document in architecture section
4. Note discovery in todo.md Learning Log

This will improve consistency across the codebase.
