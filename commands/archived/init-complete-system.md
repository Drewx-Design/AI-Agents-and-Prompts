# Initialize Complete 4-File System

Use this when you've already filled in all 4 files and want Claude to understand and begin development.

```
INITIALIZE 4-FILE SYSTEM FOR DEVELOPMENT

I've created and filled in all 4 files for this project:
- CLAUDE.md - Contains project vision, current focus, and working systems
- RULES.md - Defines technology stack and quality standards
- prompt_plan.md - Has complete implementation roadmap with phases and tasks
- todo.md - Shows first task ready to execute with tracking initialized

Please:

1. READ AND UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM:
   - Read CLAUDE.md for project context and navigation
   - Read RULES.md for constraints and standards
   - Read prompt_plan.md for implementation strategy
   - Read todo.md for current execution state

2. VERIFY SYSTEM INTEGRITY:
   - Confirm all cross-references between files are valid
   - Check task complexity scoring is appropriate
   - Verify dependencies form logical progression
   - Ensure Working Systems are properly documented

3. CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING:
   - Summarize the project in 2-3 sentences
   - List the top 3-5 Working Systems to preserve
   - Identify the current active task and its complexity
   - Note any potential issues or inconsistencies found

4. BEGIN DEVELOPMENT:
   - Start executing the active task from todo.md
   - Follow the EPCC pattern (Explore, Plan, Code, Commit)
   - Update Implementation State tracking as you work
   - Use memory updates (#) to capture important patterns
   - Play completion sound when task is done

Ready to begin development with full context of the 4-file system.
