# Add Complex Task

For unclear requirements that need exploration and clarification.

```
COMPLEX TASK NEEDS CLARIFICATION

I have a complex/unclear task idea that needs the Task Creation Template:

ROUGH IDEA:
"[DESCRIBE YOUR VAGUE/COMPLEX REQUIREMENT]"

CONTEXT:
- Current systems: [WHAT'S WORKING]
- Pain point: [WHAT PROBLEM THIS SOLVES]
- Not sure about: [WHAT'S UNCLEAR]

Please:
1. Use EPCC pattern to EXPLORE this requirement
2. Ask clarifying questions one at a time
3. PLAN the technical approach
4. Create proper task specification
5. Assess if this fits current session

Use 'think' mode if this seems architecturally complex.
