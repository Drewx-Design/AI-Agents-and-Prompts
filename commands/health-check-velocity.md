VELOCITY AND PERFORMANCE CHECK

Analyze current development velocity:

METRICS REQUEST:
- Tasks completed today: [COUNT]
- Average time vs estimates:
  - Simple tasks: [ACTUAL] vs 25 min
  - Medium tasks: [ACTUAL] vs 45 min
  - High tasks: [ACTUAL] vs 75 min

PERFORMANCE VS BASELINE:
- Story completion rate: [X]% vs 160% target
- Debug time reduction: [X]% vs 60% target
- Onboarding efficiency: [DAYS] vs 3 days target

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Should we adjust estimates?
- Any patterns in overruns?
- Process improvements needed?
